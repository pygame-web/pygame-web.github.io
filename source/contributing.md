## To these docs

These docs are built with sphinx. See the github page. They take inspiration
from the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr) approach, as well as the documentation
sites for [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/),
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org), and [furo](https://pradyunsg.me/furo/).

Markdown files are formatted with prettier (see the prettierrc) and python code
blocks are formatted with black.
