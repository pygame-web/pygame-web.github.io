[Panda3D is a framework for 3D rendering and game development for Python and C++ programs.](https://pypi.org/project/Panda3D/)

[original documentation](https://docs.panda3d.org/1.10/python/index)

typical import, note the PEP block at the top which specify to pip install Panda3D wheel
```
# /// script
# dependencies = [
#    "panda3d",
# ]
# ///

import panda3d.core as p3d
```

## main loop

ShowBase.run() - the default loop - must be patched because it is not async, for convenience
pygbag runtime applies a monkey-patch to do that automatically.

eg for running asteroids sample, go into panda3d/samples/asteroids/
edit main.py to add
```py
# /// script
# dependencies = [
#    "panda3d",
# ]
# ///
```
then run eg `python3 -m pygbag --PYBUILD 3.12 --git --ume_block 0 --template notctx.tmpl main.py` to use cpython 3.12 with pygbag git
and go to http://localhost:8000/?-i

But if you use taskMgr.step() or use the wheel in your own python runtime then you should do it that way:
```python
async def main():
    while True:
        taskMgr.step()
        await asyncio.sleep(0)

if __name__=="__main__":
    asyncio.run( main() )
```

If you don't want to use asyncio it is also possible to use a generator function as a main() but that method is not very suitable for readable cross platform code.


## shaders
Use either '#version 100' GLES1/2 or GLES3 
Like this:
```
#version 300 es
precision mediump float;
```

Precision is mandatory, also mobile devices are often single precicision.

# conversion tutorial

the basic command to produce a itch.io compatible zip is

```
python -m pygbag --archive --template noctx.tmpl --ume_block 0 main.py
```

note: only use `--ume_block 0` when you have no sound playing at game startup ( loading screen / main menu )

This zip archive can be uploaded directly on itch after selection on the HTML game type . (provided everything else works and is set up as detailed below)

## changes to the code.

The base used was [https://github.com/BMaxV/panda3d_shading 03main.py](https://github.com/BMaxV/panda3d_shading 03main.py)

note: preferably use a 1024x600 screen size.

## changes to the code for web

so my original code uses this kind of mainloop:

```python
def main():
    W = Wrapper()
    while True:
        delta_t = globalClock.dt
        W.b.taskMgr.step()
        W.main(delta_t)

if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
```

Which has the advantage that it's "obvious" where the main loop takes place. `W.main` is performing the steps defined by the programmer/user and `W.b.taskMgr.step()` executes all the engine functionality, like rendering.

this is changed to, note the PEP 723 block to tell the runtime you will use Panda3D wasm wheel so it gets downloaded
and installed.

```python

# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   "panda3d",
# ]
# ///

async def main(): # this one defines the main as async
    W = Wrapper()
    while True:
        delta_t = globalClock.dt
        W.b.taskMgr.step()
        W.main(delta_t)
        await asyncio.sleep(0) # this line is new

if __name__=="__main__":
    asyncio.run( main() ) # this is asyncronously running main.
```

with an additional import of

```python
import pygbag.aio as asyncio
```

which "gives control to the browser" in between ticks.

## importing a "pure python" custom module

For example the imported custom module is https://github.com/BMaxV/panda3d_interface_glue and that one should have no dependencies except Panda3D.

NB: If module uses Numpy be sure to add "import numpy" at top of your main.py

This is a good example for importing your custom modules but you can also download the wheel from pypi, where pure python wheels usually have "py3-none" in their name.

Here I built the "interface glue" with

```
python3 setup.py bdist_wheel --universal
```

which builds the module into a wheel at `interfacegluedir/dist` The wheel then should be unpacked with some zip unpacking. The folder of interest is the `panda_interface_glue` folder, that has to exist at the same level as your main.py



## testing

If you leave `--archive` out, it starts a local webserver instead and you can visit (default) http://localhost:8000/ to test how well it works.

You can visit [http://localhost:8000/?-i](http://localhost:8000/?-i) instead to get to the debug console.

The name `main.py` is actually important, your main file has to be called `main.py`, alternative names will not work.
